# DEEP ADVERSARIAL ACTIVE LEARNING WITH MODEL UNCERTAINTY FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
By Zheng Zhu(zzhu@cqu.edu.cn), Hongxing Wang

## Introduction

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation for the paper ["Deep Adversarial Active Learning with Model Uncertainty for Image Classification"] in ICIP2020. It brings the AL models trained on the [CIFAR10/100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),[SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) and [Caltech256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/).
